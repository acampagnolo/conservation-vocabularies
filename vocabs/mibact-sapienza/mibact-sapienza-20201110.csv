"mbs:1","historical centre","centro storico",,,,,"Ensemble of historic buildings within an urban agglomeration formed by World War I (1919).This chronological threshold normally identifies a part - generally central - of the town, but the contemporary city can also include several historical districts that are in fact disjointed. This center is delimited by a perimetration that can sometimes coincide with the boundary of the walls when it still exists or when it can be identified on the basis of historical cadastres or the material evidence of the building, or with some natural limits (streams, strong slopes, etc.) sometimes it results from the evident constructive mutation of the building, verified by the comparison with the available cartographic and historical graphic docuemnation and direct feedback.  "
"mbs:2","urban space","spazio urbano",,"mbs:1","mbs:7"," mbs:11","it constitutes an open space inside the historic center bordered by several 'urban fronts' and characterized by the presence of specific elements (gardens, furnishings, flooring, etc.). In theory, all the streets, squares and wide slars contained within the center are urban spaces. "
"mbs:3","urban unit","unità urbana",,"mbs:1","mbs:5",,"It constitutes a portion of the built fabric of the historic center morphologically and structurally autonomous and clearly identifiable. It appears to be bounded by a variable number of fronts, all or part of which are on urban spaces with whom it communicates through the access to the ground floor. The urban unit can be constituted as an 'aggregate' or as a 'residential or specialistic punctual building unit'"
"mbs:4","urban units-aggregates ","Unità urbana-aggregato",,"mbs:1","mbs:2",,"It is a type of 'urban unit' and is understood as a continuous set of structurally connected but distinguishable building units as organisms that are architecturally coherent. It is bordered by urban spaces with which it communicates through accesses to the ground floor and may contain within it places relevant to one or more building units. It overlooks on urban spaces through fronts that result from the succession of the individual facades of the building units. "
"mbs:5","urban units-residential or specialistic punctual buildings","unità urbana-edilizia puntuale residenziale o specialistica",,"mbs:1","mbs:3","mbs:2","It is a type of 'urban unit' and is understood as a homogeneous and autonomous unitary element. It is bordered by urban spaces with whom it communicates through accesses to the ground floor and can contain open places inside. It overlooks urban spaces through a variable number of fronts generally figuratively and constructively coherent with each other. 'Residential punctual building units' are buildings such as villas or cottages, while 'Specialist punctual building units' include hospitals or schools. "
"mbs:6","building unit","unità edilizia ",,"mbs:3",,,"It is a coherent architectural organism, consisting in a single construction phase or by the merging/recasting of several pre-existing building units. This organism is characterized by the presence of one or more functional units (residential and non-residential) connected to each other through common distribution elements and served by access at the road level; it is bordered by external facades with a generally continuous eaves line and a unitary or composite roof composed of flat and/or inclined parts consistent with all fronts."
"mbs:7","building front","fronte edilizio",,"mbs:6","mbs:2",,"It corresponds to the façade of the single 'building unit' overlooking on an urban space or, more generally, on a street or a town square but also on the natural margin of the town (maritime, river, lake coast, prmonatory limit, etc.)."
"mbs:8","architectural heritage","bene architettonico",,,"mbs:1",,"Built works transmitted inter-generationally within a society and that are invested with significance in that society (AAT scope note)"
"mbs:9","archeological heritage","bene archeologico",,,"mbs:1",,"Built works remains of past human life and activities, generally referred to a period ranging from ancient  to early medieval time."
"mbs:10","parks","parchi",,,"mbs:1",,"Permanently dedicated recreation areas, often open to the public and generally characterized by their natural, historic, or landscape features; often administered by governmental agencies  (AAT scope note)."
"mbs:11","gardens ","giardini",,,"mbs:1","mbs:2","Area of ground or open space; usually, but not always, where flowers, shrubs, trees, vegetables, or fruits are grown and cultivated  (AAT scope note)."

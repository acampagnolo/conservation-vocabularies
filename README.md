## Conservation vocabularies repository
This repository hosts raw data representing conservation vocabularies: both published thesauri as well as local wordlists and vocabularies used in institutions or studios. The repository also hosts alignment data between different vocabularies. Best practices for the use of the repository are still being agreed. Current discussions are captured in the [Terminology Guidelines document](https://www.ligatus.org.uk/lcd/output/193).
